If you're in IT today, you need to know about Kubernetes and Docker.

Even if you don't plan to be an expert, understanding Kubernetes and Docker is crucial.

They are the foundation of modern IT systems, and they keep your skills up-to-date in a rapidly advancing field.

Imagine you have an application designed to serve millions globally.

You containerize it - essentially packing it in containers, like shipping containers of the software world. But how do you manage these containers?

Enter Kubernetes.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀-𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿?

Suppose you have a Kubernetes cluster with 50 nodes, each with 8 CPU cores and 32 GB RAM. That sums up to:

- Total CPU cores: 50 nodes * 8 cores/node = 400 CPU cores
- Total Memory: 50 nodes * 32 GB/node = 1600 GB RAM

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗹 𝗽𝗼𝗱𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗽?

Kubernetes 𝗽𝗼𝗱𝘀 are the 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘀 that can be created and managed.

If each pod is allocated 0.5 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM, your cluster can theoretically run:

- Total pods (by CPU): 400 cores / 0.5 core/pod = 800 pods
- Total pods (by memory): 1600 GB / 2 GB/pod = 800 pods

In perfect equilibrium, you can run 800 pods concurrently.

Kubernetes uses something called Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, which automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization.

𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗦𝗽𝗶𝗸𝗲: 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗱𝗼𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁?

With auto-scaling, Kubernetes can double the number of pods to maintain service quality.

If a node is saturated, it'll even start up new nodes, distributing the load evenly.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿?

Kubernetes constantly checks the health of nodes and pods, restarting those that fail.

It distributes pods across nodes to minimize the impact of a single node's failure.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀?

Kubernetes rolls out application updates without downtime.

It gradually replaces instances of the old version of your application with the new one.

𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀?

Despite its robustness, Kubernetes isn't immune to problems.

Misconfigurations can cause service disruptions.

However, its design minimizes potential failures and recovery is swift.

Let's keep things simple:

Kubernetes is complex, don't make it harder than it needs to be.
